# Elephant-alert-and-tracking-system
Human-elephant conflict (HEC) and its consequences are a burning issue in corridors of northern Chhattisgarh. To find an effective solution which deals with human-elephant conflict is one of the most challenging tasks for elephant management. Elephants harm the local surroundings by destroying crops, killing people and livestock, demolishing houses and grain supplies. Thus creating havoc and incurring a significant amount of financial damage to the system. So we are motivated to design a system that can act as an early alert system. The main idea is to protect the lives of people lost as well as the damage sustained to the crops and also preserve the elephant habitat .The system allows to create an alert as well track live elephant movement along with storage of the same for future analysis and prediction. Further in the upcoming phase, image classification and sound detection of elephants will be used for creating elephant infiltration alerts.
